About me
====
I'm a PhD  student in mathematics. I started my PhD in October 2025 at CERMICS (Ecole nationale des ponts et chaussées), advised by [Tony Lelièvre](http://cermics.enpc.fr/~lelievre/) and [Gabriel Stoltz](http://cermics.enpc.fr/~stoltz) on the topic: "Mathematical methods and numercial analysis for sampling metastable dynamics". I am also a member of the Inria MATHERIALS team.
